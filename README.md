# Data-Structures

## Implementation of data structures using python3 programming language.
### This repo will contain implementation of all data structures, startig from basic to advance data structures.

* A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in computer so that in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

### 1. [ARRAY](https://github.com/dhruvsharma1999/data-structures/tree/main/arrays)
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array

### 2. [LINKED LIST](https://github.com/dhruvsharma1999/data-structures/tree/main/linkedlists)
a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

### 3. [STACKS AND QUEUES](https://github.com/dhruvsharma1999/data-structures-algorithms/tree/main/stack_queues)

1. Stacks - Stack A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.

2. Queue -  A queue is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only from one side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from the other side called the front. The queue data structure follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

### 4. [BINARY SEARCH TREE](https://github.com/dhruvsharma1999/data-structures-algorithms/tree/main/binary_tree)

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
