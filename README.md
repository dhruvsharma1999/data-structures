# Data-Structures

## Implementation of data structures using python3 programming language.
### This repo will contain implementation of all data structures, startig from basic to advance data structures.

* A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in computer so that in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

### 1. [ARRAY](https://github.com/dhruvsharma1999/data-structures/tree/main/arrays)
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array

### 2. [LINKED LIST](https://github.com/dhruvsharma1999/data-structures/tree/main/linkedlists)
a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
